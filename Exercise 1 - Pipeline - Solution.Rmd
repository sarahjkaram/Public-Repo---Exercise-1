### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#### Solution to Exercise 1 - Pipeline - Formative 

## Step 1

# Loading tidyverse and dplyr
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

# Loaded the cars dataset
data(cars)   

# Asked for a summary of the cars dataset
summary(cars) 

# Created a function to calculate time. Added a new column for time to the dataset. Returned the new dataset
calculate_time <- function(cars) {
  
  data <- cars %>%
    mutate(time = round(dist / speed, 1))
  

  return(data)
}

# Applied the function to the cars dataset 
cars_with_time <- calculate_time(cars)

# Viewed the cars data with time added
print(cars_with_time)

# Created a table of the altered cars dataset using tibble 
cars_tibble <- as_tibble(cars_with_time)

# Viewed the new cars tibble
print(cars_tibble) 

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
