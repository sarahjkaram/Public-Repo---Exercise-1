## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(USArrests)
head()
print(USArrests)
```
This dataset is tidy because each row demonstrates an observation 
There is one value and one variable per cell and each variable forms its own column.

each cell contains a variable that is mutually exclusive from the rest. In other words, we don't see one variable spread over multiple cells.


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
